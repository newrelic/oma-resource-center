# New Relic Observability Maturity Architecture (OMA) Resource Center

OMA is New Relic's methodology for delivering observability platform value.  It defines value drivers and use cases which can be followed to deliver specific business outcomes.  Each use case defines KPIs that measure progress towards the defined outcome and best practices to improve those KPIs.  They also provide value realization so executive stakeholders can measure progress and see results.

Available value drivers include:
- Uptime, Performance, and Reliability
- Operational Efficiency
- Innovation and Growth
- Customer Experience

This repo contains artifacts that support the implementation of the various OMA value drivers and use cases.  

[For more details see these docs.](https://docs.newrelic.com)


## Usage
To get started, review the OMA documentation [found here](https://docs.newrelic.com) and identify the value driver and use case you want to implement.  The use case docs will refer you to the appropriate place within this repo for any supporting technical artifacts needed.
